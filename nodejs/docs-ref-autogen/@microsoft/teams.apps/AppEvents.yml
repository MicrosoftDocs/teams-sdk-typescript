  Combines two sets of event types:

  1. Base events from IEvents interface (these are core-events)

  2. Custom events from all registered plugins that extend PluginWithEvents


  For any given event key K:

  - If K exists in IEvents, use the event type from IEvents (i.e. prioritizes
  core-events)

  - If K exists in plugin events, use the event type from plugins

  - Otherwise, the type is never


  This creates a unified event type map that prioritizes base events

  while still including all plugin-specific events.
