  Gathers input fields, merges with optional data field, and sends an event to
  the client. It is up to the client to determine how this data is processed.
  For example: With BotFramework bots, the client would send an activity through
  the messaging medium to the bot. The inputs that are gathered are those on the
  current card, and in the case of a show card those on any parent cards. See
  https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/adaptive-cards/authoring-cards/input-validation
